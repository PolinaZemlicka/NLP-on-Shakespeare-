Natural Language Processing on Shakespeare texts

A STUDY OF ROMEO AND JULIET IN ORIGINAL AND TRANSLATIONS 
ALL TEXTS TAKEN FROM https://www.gutenberg.org/


WOULD THE NUMBER OF WORDS AND TOTAL WORD COUNT BE DIFFERENT IN TRANSLATIONS?
Original English, German, Russian, French and Polish.
Texts were compared and data visualized.

Then we narrow down on the original English text:
How many character are there and how many times do they speak?

Used: python, pandas, matplotlib

Work in progress:
compare number of lines per characterin translations.

Track number of lines exchanged between specific characters.

Track character movements and create a GUI timeline.
